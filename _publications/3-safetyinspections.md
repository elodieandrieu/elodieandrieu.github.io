title: "It's No Accident: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Vehicle Safety Inspections"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/safetyinspections
excerpt: 'Improvements in vehicle technology mean that vehicles are safer and more reliable than in the past. Accordingly, some states have begun to discontinue their requirements for vehicle safety inspections. To gauge the effect of these policy changes, we examine traffic fatality data from 2000 to 2015, using a synthetic controls analysis with emphasis on New Jersey, which ended its inspection requirements in 2010.'
