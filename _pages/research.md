###Job Market Paper: Can Firm Subsidies Spread Growth? [!DRAFT AVAILABLE!](http://elodieandrieu.github.io/files/andrieu_morrow_can_firm_subsidies_spread_gowth_sept2024) (with John Morrow)
How do firms diffuse resources and do they spillover outside headquarter intensive areas? We show R&D subsidies induce French firms to hire new workers, often in new establishments and commuting zones. Using subsidy induced labor demand shocks and past employment patterns, we estimate a within industry spillover elasticity of .26 to non-subsidy firms, rising to .35 for openings outside of headquarter areas. Spillovers are also significant across firm branches and for firms. While subsidies are nominally awarded to headquarters, firms expand to distribute spillovers more broadly.


## Working Papers

**Minimum Wage and Skills : Evidence from Job Vacancy Data** (with Mary O’Mahony)
Increases in the minimum wage aim to benefit low-wage workers but may lead firms to offset costs by substituting low-skilled labor with higher-skilled workers or adopting new technology. Following a significant and unexpected UK minimum wage hike in 2016, we found a reduced demand for low-educated and high Risk of Automation (ROA) jobs, coupled with an increased demand for technical skills. Using a differencein-differences framework, this paper provides evidence of labor-labor substitution at the low-end of the skill distribution and labor-technology substitution, showing a shift towards jobs requiring advanced technical skills.

**Measuring the Impact of Lobbying by Exploiting the Complementarity Between Influence Tools** (with Olimpia Cutinelli-Rendina)
How does corporate lobbying affect firm performance ? We provide evidence that lobbying and campaign contributions are strategically linked, and firms use campaign contributions as long-term investments recognizing that legislators will enter important committees over time. We exploit this complementarity using a shift-share instrumental variable design to estimate the impact of lobbying on firm size, financial performance and investments. We find that lobbying positively impacts sales, financial performance and capital expenditures, but not R&D expenditures.

**Uncertainty and the COVID-19 crisis: Evidence from online job postings** (with C. Criscuolo and M. Squicciarini)
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered large declines in economic activity, impacting different industries, firms and workers in heterogeneous ways. This paper uses Burning Glass Technologies’ online job posting data for the United Kingdom for the period 2019-May 21 to study the impact of the decline in activity and rise in uncertainty related to the pandemic on local labour markets. This paper uses a measure of local labour market exposure to the global pandemic shock. We find that areas that were more exposed saw a larger decline in online job adverts during the crisis. Controlling for demand and supply shocks, rise in global uncertainty has an additional effect on labour markets that needs to be taken into account to quantify the effects of the crisis.
