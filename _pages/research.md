## Work in progress
Working on BGT data (on-going work about covid-19, education, tech skills). On-going work using the French firm level data.

Multi-establishment Firm Structure and Subsidies (with John Morrow) - draft available (March 2023).
Abstract: How do Multiple Establishment (ME) firms distribute resources across establishments, and does this result in spillovers far from headquarters. This paper describes ME firm structure in France and estimates the impact of subsidies on establishment structure, employment composition and spillovers to external proximate establishments. In response to the subsidy, ME firms open new establishments and their footprint expands, while hiring occupations at different rates. The most responsive occupations are techies and high-skill support workers in line with R&D targetting of the subsidy, with most occupational growth coming through new establishments. Evaluating the policy, we estimate an employment spillover elasticity of 1.3% at the postcode level and 10% at the commuting zone level within industry, but no significant effect across industries. Spillover hiring is highest in techies and high-skill support workers. While subsidies may nominally be given to headquarters in high-skill advanced areas, ME firms function to redistribute employment and positive spillovers more broadly.

Minimum Wage and Skills: Evidence from Job Vacancy Data (with M. Kuczera) - first draft available (Feb 2022).
Abstract: Low-wage occupations tend to be populated by workers with low levels of education. An increase in the minimum wage, while designed to protect workers in the low part of the wage distribution, might result in unintended consequences for those same workers. In this paper, we study firms' reaction to higher minimum wages, exploiting the 2016 minimum-wage policy in the UK. We document how an increase in the minimum wage affects the labour hiring for different education and technical skill levels of workers. The results show that an increase in the minimum wage compressed the demand for low-educated workers while at the same time expanded the demand for workers with technical skills (tech workers) in low and middle skilled occupations. Using a differences-in-differences framework, we find that a large and unexpected change to the minimum wage led to a 6 percentage point decrease in the proportion of non-graduate vacancies. There is evidence for labour-labour substitution and labour-capital substitution as a way to compensate for labour costs increases.

Uncertainty and the COVID-19 crisis: Evidence from online job postings (with C. Criscuolo and M. Squicciarini) - first draft available (2021).
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered large declines in economic activity, impacting different industries, firms and workers in heterogeneous ways. This paper uses Burning Glass Technologies’ online job posting data for the United Kingdom for the period 2019-May 21 to study the impact of the decline in activity and rise in uncertainty related to the pandemic on local labour markets. This paper uses a measure of local labour market exposure to the global pandemic shock. We find that areas that were more exposed saw a larger decline in online job adverts during the crisis. Controlling for demand and supply shocks, rise in global uncertainty has an additional effect on labour markets that needs to be taken into account to quantify the effects of the crisis.
