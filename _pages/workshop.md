# Junior Research Day - Fourth Edition 2024

## April 23rd @ the Collège de France - Paris - [!Final Program!](http://elodieandrieu.github.io/files/JRD_PROGRAM_Apr2024.pdf)

The Junior Research Day is jointly organised by **King's College London** and the **Collège de France**. It aims to bring together PhD and young researchers in Economics and to build a community among econ PhDs from different universities. Also, it is a place where you get the chance to train presenting polished papers as well as pitching an idea in front of a friendly audience from which they can also get feedback.  
The Research day consists of a mix between short presentations (20 minutes) and longer presentations (40 minutes) including questions/discussion. The day will begin at 9.30am (with coffee) and end at 5.30pm. There will be multiple breaks and lunch to allow young researchers to meet as well as a social event immediately after the last presentation. If you would like to attend, please contact us. We gratefully acknowledge the generous support from KBS KCL and Flores Anderson's crucial help with the organisation.
