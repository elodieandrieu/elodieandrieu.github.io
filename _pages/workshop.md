# Junior Research Day

## King's College London - Tuesday 15 November 2022

The PhD Research Day aims to bring together PhD and young researchers in Economics. The goal of the day is to build a community among econ PhDs from different universities. Also, it is a place where researchers get the chance to train presenting polished papers as well as pitching an idea in front of a friendly audience from which they can also get feedback.  
The Research day consists of a mix between short presentations (20 minutes) and longer presentations (40 minutes) including questions/discussion. The day will begin at 9.30am (with coffee) and end at 5.30pm. There will be multiple breaks and lunch to allow young researchers to meet as well as a social event immediately after the last presentation. You are all welcome to attend!
