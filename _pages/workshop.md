# Junior Research Day - Fifth Edition !

## November 20th @ [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) - London

The Junior Research Day was initialy jointly organised by **King's College London** and the **Collège de France**. We now expand to other universities in London and Paris. It aims to bring together PhD and young researchers in Economics and to build a community among econ PhDs from different universities. Also, it is a place where you get the chance to train presenting polished papers as well as pitching an idea in front of a friendly audience from which they can also get feedback.  
The Research day consists of a mix between short presentations and longer presentations including questions/discussion. The day usually begins around 9.00am (with coffee) and ends late afternoon. There are multiple breaks and lunch to allow young researchers to meet as well as a social event immediately after the last presentation. We gratefully acknowledge the generous support from KBS KCL, Collège de France and the host university.
