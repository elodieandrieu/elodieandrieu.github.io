## About me
I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at **Paris School of Economics**. I obtained my PhD from **King's College London** in 2023. Prior to joining Kingâ€™s College London, I worked as a Consultant at **The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development** (OECD) in Paris in the Science, Technology and Innovation department.

My research focuses on the interaction between firm organisations and innovation, by studying how firms distribute resources internally, and the resulting spillovers far from headquarters. I mainly work on the French firm level data to understand propagation of innovation within boundaries of firms. I also use Burning Glass Technologies data in many different projects (covid-19, education, tech skills).
