### About me

I am a fourth-year economics PhD student at **King's College London**, under the supervision of **Mary O'Mahony** and **John Morrow**.
I hold a Master degree in Economics from the **Paris School of Economics**, and BA degree in Economics from the **Aix-Marseille University**. 

Prior to joining Kingâ€™s College London, I worked as a Consultant at **The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development** (OECD) in Paris in the Science, Technology and Innovation department, under the supervision of Dr. Mariagrazia Squicciarini.
I was part of the Economic, Analysis and Statistics research team working on estimating the monetary cost of the training needed to move workers displaced by automation across occupations.

I mainly work on the French firm level data to understand propagation of innovation within boundaries of firms. I also use Burning Glass Technologies data in many different projects (covid-19, education, tech skills). 

### Research interests

Labour economics, innovation, firms dynamics, productivity and tasks/skills
